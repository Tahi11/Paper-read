\subsubsection {Evaluation\\}
One of the identified gaps in my research is the lack of evaluation for the existing studies. Most studies did not map their experiments result on the industry needs and impacts. That means the obtained results are similar to the manual study performed in the industry, if yes then how much? Also, how efficient results automated systems are providing to the users by considering the extra information and non-relevant information? I plan to perform this evaluation study as given below: \\
\begin {itemize}
\item{The first method to evaluate the results is to draw a comparison between two different versions of one application. The specific application data will be collected before the new version. All the requirements given by the proposed system will be matched in the new version. Each identified requirement exist in the new version or not will be checked manually.\\}
\item{The second method is the automated version of first method. For this two dataset before and after the new version will be compared. This method will compare which requirements  are mentioned by users in the first dataset i.e. before the new version. A tracability link for these requirements will be generated in the second dataset i.e. after new version. If users has stopped asking about these requirements after the release, we assumed that those requirements are now part of the application in the new version.\\}
\item{In the third method, I will perform an industrial case study that will investigate the difference in the developer requirements list result and my tool result list. The developer will mark the similar requirements in both results and give comments on  comparisons. From these results, we can see the correctness and efficiency of our system. This study will help to provide the beter insight of the comparison due to the comments. That will ultimately help to provide better evaluation.\\}
\end{itemize}
This study has threats to validity such as if requirement identified by my proposed system is not devolped in the new version due to some constraints e.g. orgnaizational policies, finance, scope of application etc. To overcome this, in the third method we will add the comments of devolper on the results for better anaylsis.
