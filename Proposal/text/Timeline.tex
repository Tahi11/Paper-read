\subsubsection {Timeline}

. Throughout my dissertation I will
continuously work on a systematic literature review [11]
in order to document the related work of my approach.
At the end, I will run an experiment in the context of a
practical course at university with a group of students in
order to validate the proposed approach. The students will
build safety case for an open system in different contexts,
in the traditional manner. In parallel, the safety cases of
the open system will be automatically adapted according
to the new operational context information (i.e., the system
of systems). It will be checked if the automatic adaptation
provides safety argumentation comparable with the ones
built via the traditional approach.
